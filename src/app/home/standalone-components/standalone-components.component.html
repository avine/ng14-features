  <h2>Standalone components</h2>
  <p>
    In v14 and higher, standalone components provide a simplified way to build Angular applications. Standalone
    components, directives, and pipes aim to streamline the authoring experience by reducing the need for NgModules.
    Existing applications can optionally and incrementally adopt the new standalone style without any breaking changes.
